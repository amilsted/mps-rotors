# mps-rotors
Python code for simulating the O(2) and O(4) rotor models using evoMPS (http://amilsted.github.io/evoMPS/).
It currently depends on the development branch of evoMPS.

## Description
This is a library of functions for computing uniform matrix product state (MPS) ground states for the O(2) and O(4) quantum rotor models and processing and visualizing the results. It is also possible to compute low-lying excited states using the uniform MPS tangent space, including computation of the mass gap.
